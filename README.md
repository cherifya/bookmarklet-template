bookmarklet-template
====================

This is a basic tool for creating bookmarklets. The implementation consists of 2 parts: an HTML file which hosts the bookmarklet loading code and a javascript file with the code to be executed by the bookmarklet. You modify these files and host them to share your bookmarklet with the world.

## Instructions
Copy this repository. Modify the values that are labeled in the HTML file (look for 'TODO'). More importantly, modify the javascript file - this is where you add your special sauce. Put the files on the internet somewhere and send anyone you'd like to share your work with a link to the HTML file.

If anyone installs your bookmarklet and you later update the javascript file, they will automatically be upgraded to the new functionality. 

## TODO
- command line tool to upload to S3
- tests!
