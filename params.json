The implementation consists of 2 parts: an HTML file which hosts the bookmarklet loading code and a javascript file with the code to be executed by the bookmarklet. You modify these files and host them to share your bookmarklet with the world.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\nCopy this repository. Modify the values that are labeled in the HTML file (look for 'TODO'). More importantly, modify the javascript file - this is where you add your special sauce. Put the files on the internet somewhere and send anyone you'd like to share your work with a link to the HTML file.\r\n\r\nIf anyone installs your bookmarklet and you later update the javascript file, they will automatically be upgraded to the new functionality. \r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n- command line tool to upload to S3\r\n- tests!\r\n- help user serve via server using http or https\r\n- lint\r\n- minfication\r\n- instructions for adding to a mobile browser","tagline":"A template for creating bookmarklets"}
